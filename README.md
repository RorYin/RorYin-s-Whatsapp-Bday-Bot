+ Edit the Setup.py
	+ Create a new TG Bot using BotFather, and copy the bot token and paste it.
	+ Create a Airtable Base, and a table, with fields as "Name", "bday", "chatid".
	+ Get your Airtable access token, table id, base id and table name.
+ Choose your fav platform to deploy, recommended is pythonanywhere as it has a option to create tasks. Else you can find a way to run the ScheduledTask.py at particular time.

# Tips

+ Deploy on pythonanywhere and set the task for Task.py to whatever time u want the bot to check and send update, currently it is set to 12AM for my deployed bot.
+ Use paid version of pythonanywhere, since there is a limitation in free version.
