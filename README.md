+ Fun to use
+ Can add to any of your personal group and start using the bot withouth deploying
+ If interested you can try deploying your own using the open source code
+ currently deployed on pythonanywhere and railway

# ReleaseNote

> Currently V1.0 bot is deployed on railway, which might soon stop, will deploy to other services, if bot stops workin anytime, you can report the same in [TG group](https://telegram.me/+gK3cgGhXuwIzMDJl).


# ToDo for next release
+ To add multiple register from one telegram user, so that one can add his/her friends list to get reminder to him personally rather than in group(if needed so).
+ To add deregister functionality.
+ To add list registered user functionality.
+ And more, as per discussion in the [group](https://telegram.me/+gK3cgGhXuwIzMDJl).


# Setup for deploying your own

+ Fork the repo (better to clone the V1.0 instead of the main branch)
+ Edit the Setup.py
	+ Create a new TG Bot using BotFather, and copy the bot token and paste it.
	+ Create a Airtable Base, and a table, with fields as "Name", "Birthday", "id", "gid".
	+ Copy and paste the airtable api key, Base Id, Tabe Id, Table Name, refer airtable docs to know how to get it or ping on [TG group](https://telegram.me/+gK3cgGhXuwIzMDJl).
+ Choose your fav platform to deploy, recommended is pythonanywhere as it has a option to create tasks. Else you can find a way to run the ScheduledTask.py at particular time.
+ Once deployed, copy pase the webapp url into setup.py "appurl", save it and redeploy.
+ Webhook has to be set for the bot, for that just go to this url "https://api.telegram.org/botYOURBOTTOKEN/setWebhook?url=YOURWEBAPPURL" by replacing bot token and web app url with yours.
+ Edit your bot description, commands, botpic using BotFather.
+ Done, bot is ready to use, check with "/start" command.
